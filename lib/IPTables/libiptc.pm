=head1 NAME

IPTables::libiptc - Perl extension for iptables libiptc

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use IPTables::libiptc;

  $table = IPTables::libiptc::init('filter');

  $table->create_chain("mychain");

  # Its important to commit/push-back the changes to the kernel
  $table->commit();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package provides a perl interface to the netfilter/iptables
C-code and library C<libiptc>.

Advantages of this module: Many rule changes can be done very
fast. Several rule changes is committed atomically.

This module is heavily inspired by the CPAN module IPTables-IPv4.  The
CPAN module IPTables-IPv4 could not be used because it has not been
kept up-to-date, with the newest iptables extensions.  This is a
result of the module design, as it contains every extension and thus
needs to port them individually.

This package has another approach, it links with the systems libiptc.a
library and depend on dynamic loading of iptables extensions available
on the system.

The module only exports the libiptc chain manipulation functions.  All
rule manipulations are done through the iptables.c C<do_command>
function.  As iptables.c is not made as a library, the package
unfortunately needs to maintain/contain this C file.

=head2 Iptables kernel to userspace design

=over

The reasoning behind making this module comes from how
iptables/libiptc communicate with the kernel.  Iptables/libiptc
transfers the entire ruleset from kernel to userspace, and back again
after making some changes to the ruleset.

This is a fairly large operation if only changing a single rule.  That
is actually the behavior of the iptables command.

Thus, with this knowledge it make sense to make several changes before
commit'ing the changes (entire ruleset) back to the kernel.  This is
the behavior/purpose of this perl module.

This is also what makes it so very fast to many rule changes. And
gives the property of several rule changes being committed atomically.


=head1 METHODS

Most methods will return 1 for success, or 0 for failure (and on
failure, set $! to a string describing the reason for the
failure). Unless otherwise noted, you can assume that all methods will
use this convention.

=head2 Chain Operations

=over

=item B<get_policy>

    my ($policy)                      = $table->get_policy('chainname');
    my ($policy, $pkt_cnt, $byte_cnt) = $table->get_policy('chainname');

This returns an array containing the default policy, and the number of
packets and bytes which have reached the default policy, in the chain
C<chainname>.  If C<chainname> does not exist, or if it is not a
built-in chain, an empty array will be returned, and $! will be set to
a string containing the reason.


=item B<set_policy>

    $success = $table->set_policy('chainname', 'target');
    $success = $table->set_policy('chainname', 'target', 'pkt_cnt', 'byte_cnt');
    ($success, $old_policy, $old_pkt_cnt, $old_pkt_cnt) = $table->set_policy('chainname', 'target');

Sets the default policy.  C<set_policy> can be called several ways.
Upon success full setting of the policy the old policy and counters
are returned.  The counter setting values are optional.

=item B<create_chain>

    $success = $table->create_chain('chainname');

=item B<is_chain>

    $success = $table->is_chain('chainname');

Checks if the chain exist.


=item B<buildin>

    $success = $table->builtin('chainname');

Tests if the chainname is a buildin chain.


=item B<delete_chain>

 $success = $table->delete_chain('chainname');

Tries to delete the chain, returns false if it could not.


=item B<get_references>

 $refs = $table->get_references('chainname');

Get a count of how many rules reference/jump to this chain.


=head2 Listing Operations

=item B<list_chains>

    @array            = $table->list_chains();
    $number_of_chains = $table->list_chains();

Lists all chains.  Returns the number of chains in SCALAR context.

=item B<list_rules_IPs>

    @array           = $table->list_rules_IPs('type', 'chainname');
    $number_of_rules = $table->list_rules_IPs('type', 'chainname');

This function lists the (rules) source or destination IPs from a given
chain.  The C<type> is either C<src> or C<dst> for source and
destination IPs.  The netmask is also listed together with the IPs,
but separated by a C</> character.  If chainname does not exist
C<undef> is returned.


=head2 Rules Operations

No rules manipulation functions is mapped/export from libiptc, instead
the iptables C<do_command> function is exported to this purpose.


=head2 Iptables commands (from iptables.h)

=item B<iptables_do_command>

    $table->iptables_do_command(\@array_ref)

Example of an array which contains a command:

    my @array = ("-I", "test", "-s", "4.3.2.1", "-j", "ACCEPT");
    $table->iptables_do_command(\@array);


=head1 EXPORT

None by default.

=head2 Exportable constants

  IPT_MIN_ALIGN
